management principles upon which the family of standards is based. <strong>[3][4] IOS 
9001deals</strong> with the requirements that organizations wishing to meet the standards 
must fulfill.

organization meets the requirements of IOS 9001. Over a million organizations 
worldwide are independently certified, making IOS 9001 is one of the most widely 
used management tools in the world today. Despite widespread use the IOS

been certifying organizations for their quality management systems since 1978. <strong>its 
first certification (FM 00001) is still extant and held by Tarmac limited, a successor to 
the original company which held this certificate. Today BSI claims to certify 
organizations at 70,000 sites globally.</strong>
